Sparse notes on Huggingface's transformer library

This repository contains some notes on how to use the transformers library from Huggingface.

**Important**: these notebooks use data that are not part of this repository, and must be downloaded separately, and more specifically:

1. The "Toxic Comments" dataset.
2. The "GLUE" data.

## TODO

The `Copy_of_XLNet_toxic_comment_classification_challenge.share.ipynb` notebook uses the padding function from Keras. Modify the code such that this dependency is no longer needed.
